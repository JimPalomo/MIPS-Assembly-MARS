# mips-prog-array-n-width

### Description:
Given a set of configurations (A, B, C) an array is developed of size 100. The width of the array is then computed and a histogram is formed. 

### Functionality:
The program is divided into three parts.
1: Generate an array of 100 numbers provided 3 given values A, B, C
2: Evaluate the width of each binary number and form an array of widths
3: Form histogram array consisting of all width computations
